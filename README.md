# TesseractOCRAPI

This is a .Net 7 API Implementation of TesseractOCRPlugin which can be deployed to accept files - OCR them and return the text it finds.  

Includes Swagger Documentation as part of the deployment for testing as only one function.

Currently this requires an Azure Vault in GetAPIKey for authorisation as such please be aware if hosting on azure etc.
